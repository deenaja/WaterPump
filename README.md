# WaterPump
This is a microPython Libary for working with Pumps,Flowmeters,Pressure Sensors,LED's, and buttons. There is a simple server also so that you can access pumps and data remotely. This can be either a remote contoler or a telnet conncection. This is all in devolpement and not considered stable yet. 

This project is in the process implementing asyncio and coroutines. Example_uasyncio/main.py uses the update class files. This code has only been tested with Adafruit Feather HUZZAH with ESP8266 WiFi.
